      <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-10">
        Penetration testing otherwise known as red teaming is a simulated cyber attack against your computer system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities. In a penetration test, security experts attempt to exploit the vulnerabilities in your system, just like a hacker would. The goal is to identify any weaknesses in your security before they can be exploited by malicious actors.
